# counting bot

This is a really simple discord bot to keep track of your counting in discord.

It was written to get to know rust and because the bot used in my favorite counting channel went offline every couple of days.

# usage

expects the bot token to be in the `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable.
run using cargo run
